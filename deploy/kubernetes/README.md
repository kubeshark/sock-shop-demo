# Installing sock-shop on Kubernetes

See the [documentation](https://microservices-demo.github.io/deployment/kubernetes-minikube.html) on how to deploy Sock Shop using Minikube.

## Kubernetes manifests

There are 2 sets of manifests for deploying Sock Shop on Kubernetes: one in the [manifests directory](manifests/), and complete-demo.yaml. The complete-demo.yaml is a single file manifest
made by concatenating all the manifests from the manifests directory, so please regenerate it when changing files in the manifests directory.

Install from the single file manifest complete-demo.yaml:

```sh
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/complete-demo.yaml
# or directly from github
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/up9inc/sock-shop-mizu-demo/master/deploy/kubernetes/complete-demo.yaml
```

Regenerate the complete-demo.yaml:

```sh
cd deploy/kubernetes
make gen-complete-demo
```

Alternatively, install from [manifests directory](manifests/):

```sh
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/manifests -R
```

## Monitoring

All monitoring is performed by prometheus. All services expose a `/metrics` endpoint. All services have a Prometheus Histogram called `request_duration_seconds`, which is automatically appended to create the metrics `_count`, `_sum` and `_bucket`.

The manifests for the monitoring are spread across the [manifests-monitoring](./manifests-monitoring) and [manifests-alerting](./manifests-alerting/) directories.

To use them, please run `kubectl create -f <path to directory>`.

### What's Included?

* Sock-shop grafana dashboards
* Alertmanager with 500 alert connected to slack
* Prometheus with config to scrape all k8s pods, connected to local alertmanager.

### Ports

Grafana will be exposed on the NodePort `31300` and Prometheus is exposed on `31090`. If running on a real cluster, the easiest way to connect to these ports is by port forwarding in a ssh command:
```
ssh -i $KEY -L 3000:$NODE_IN_CLUSTER:31300 -L 9090:$NODE_IN_CLUSTER:31090 ubuntu@$BASTION_IP
```
Where all the pertinent information should be entered. Grafana and Prometheus will be available on `http://localhost:3000` or `:9090`.

If on Minikube, you can connect via the VM IP address and the NodePort.
